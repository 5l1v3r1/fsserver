# fsserver

**fsserver** (pronounced "FS server") is an HTTP server which serves contents from the filesystem. It supports directory listings, index files, and various MIME types.

# Installation

This project is written in [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install). You will need Go in order to compile it from source.

You can download the repository like this:

    go get -u github.com/unixpickle/fsserver

And install it like this:

    go install github.com/unixpickle/fsserver

You should now have an `fsserver` command.

# Usage

The `fsserver` command can take the following options:

    -index="index.html": the index filename
    -path=".": the directory to serve
    -port=80: server port number
    -silent=false: disable logging

For example, you can serve the directory "/Users/alex/Desktop" on port 8080 using this command:

    fsserver -path=/Users/alex/Desktop -port=8080

# Updating [lib/bindata.go](lib/bindata.go)

Notice that web-related files are stored in the [lib/assets](lib/assets) directory. Changing files in this directory will not update them in the Go code; the Go code uses [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) to compile these assets statically.

So, if you don't have go-bindata, install it like this:

    go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata
    go install github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata

Now you can generate bindata.go from the assets directory:

    cd lib
    go-bindata -pkg=fsserver assets/...
    cd -
